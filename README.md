The need of safety for our homes can be accomplished by making the locks more electrical and coping up with the upcoming technology of internet of things.
This idea is not just confined to the small spaces but also the large spaces like industrial spaces.
For example, some technology devices are used for automatic door locking and unlocking.
Such systems are usually made using digital keypads, RFID card readers etc. 
The main objective of this project is to provide safety to personal spaces like home.
In this system the user will be setting the password and when the correct passcode is entered, user will be given access by unlocking the door.
If any intruder tries unlocking then the buzzer will create alarm and in the meantime SMS will be sent to the user alarming about intruder at the door.
